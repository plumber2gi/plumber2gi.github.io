If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety preventative measures you need to take to secure yourself, your family and your home. Some jurisdictions likewise allow options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
