<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly constant, use never exactly matches supply.
