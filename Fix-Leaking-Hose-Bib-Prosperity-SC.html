<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
