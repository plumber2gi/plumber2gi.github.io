If you look at your home's plumbing pipes and see stains, staining, flaking, little indentations or rust, your pipes are rusting.

<p>Slow drains. A slow drain can be a common plumbing issue, and most obstructions can be resolved with a basic fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning. The problem can be a deeper obstruction somewhere in the main sewer line if the basic unclogging techniques don't work to solve the slow drain. Sadly, mainline clogs are typically much bigger blockages than require more than simple unclogging approaches, however digging into the line itself to access the source of the problem.</p>
<p>More complex is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has found widespread use given that it prevents both siphonage and back pressure. The paired check valves are arranged in line with the pipeline and operate separately of each other. A set of four test dicks allow the operator to analyze the valves and make certain they are not being forced open by built up debris. Each spring-loaded check valve is set to enable water at anticipated functional pressure to stream through. Should backflow take place, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs slam the valves shut tight, avoiding the entrance of cross contamination water.</p>
