<p>A typical water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a neighboring drainpipe or drywell.

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
