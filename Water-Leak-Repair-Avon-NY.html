I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial blockage that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
