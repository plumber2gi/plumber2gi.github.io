<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Most home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
