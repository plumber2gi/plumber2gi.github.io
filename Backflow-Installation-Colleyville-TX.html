<p>Backflow is bad news. Secure the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the diminished brine option after the regeneration cycle. Clamp the drain hose safely and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To avoid the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain tubes need to have an air gap. Completion of the hose be at least two inches above the dedicated drain. An air gap might be utilized to attain this, and may be required depending on local plumbing codes.</p>

<p>The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the second highest energy consuming area of a home, next to heating & cooling. The amount of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.

Some states require steamfitters and pipefitters to be licensed; they may likewise require a special license to deal with gas lines. Licensing typically needs a test or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board to learn more.</p>
