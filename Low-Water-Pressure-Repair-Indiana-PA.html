An authorized backflow prevention assembly has actually gone through an approval process at the Foundation for Hydraulic Research Study and Cross-Connection Control at the University of Southern California. This is a two-step process of laboratory tests and a 12-month field test. Only assemblies effectively completing the whole testing treatment are recognized by IRWD as approved backflow prevention assemblies.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately check a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
