<p>Similar to kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your sink, bathtub, or shower) can be treated easily if the blockage is shallow and simple. For a lot of clogs you'll simply need a plunger, and in some cases some chemicals, but if this doesn't fix the problem then you may also have to contact a drain professional like Reckon & Reckon to assist.

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a procedure called ion exchange to eliminate hard water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical procedure known as Template Assisted Condensation (TAC). This procedure converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that will not stick to any surface in your home, keeping your appliances and hot water heaters without hard water scale develop. Salt-free softeners are also called water conditioners because they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or neutralize) it. And since these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to remove caught ions.</p>
