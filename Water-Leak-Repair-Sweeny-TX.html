<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water.

When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a threat to the digestion system.
