<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks beverages. Many, if not most, water pipes are made of copper.

The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
