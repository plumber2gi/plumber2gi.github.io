This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a threat to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
