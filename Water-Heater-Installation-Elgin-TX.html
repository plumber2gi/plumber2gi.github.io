<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic system from your home. When you experience clogs in numerous drains simultaneously in your house, then that typically means that your main sewer line is backing up. This can take place in multiple areas and any mix of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from several drain lines in your house.</p>

<p>A newly installed hot water heater should not produce unusual noises, however it will start to generate rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder over time as the heater goes to heat the water. Things aggravate dramatically for households with a high demand for warm water. The factors for the noises can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement might be required.</p>

<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain won't fix the problem. You might need to look into using a high pressure water system to get rid of the clog. This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the severity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>
