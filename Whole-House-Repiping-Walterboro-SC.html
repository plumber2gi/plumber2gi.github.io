<p>In an irrigation system, backflow has 2 causes: back siphonage or back pressure. Practically all parts on a hot water heater can be repaired or replaced except for the tank itself. Once the tank rusts through, there is no chance to repair it; replacement is the only solution. Turn the garbage disposal over and get rid of electrical cover plate. Take out wires. Insert cable television port (not included) and run electrical cable television through gain access to hole on bottom of garbage disposal. Tighten up cable connector. Press wires into garbage disposal (do not displace cardboard shield) and replace electrical cover plate.</p>
<p>A few local authorities require that the PVB be set up within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't use a PVB unless the water source is at the high end of the irrigated area.

Some do not enable the use of a PVB at all, so talk to your water provider. A PVB backflow preventer may spill or spit water out of under the cap when backflow happens, so it ought to be set up in a place where water spillage would not trigger problems.</p>
