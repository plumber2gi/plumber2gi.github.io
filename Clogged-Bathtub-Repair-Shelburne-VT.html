<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is merely capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (normally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
