<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a procedure called ion exchange to eliminate difficult water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical procedure called Template Assisted Condensation (TAC). This procedure converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that won't stick to any surface in your house, keeping your appliances and hot water heaters devoid of difficult water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are also called water conditioners because they do not actually soften" the water; They condition (or neutralize) it. And because these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to eliminate recorded ions.</p>
