Test cocks, or little ball valves, allow the attachment of testing devices that examines whether the check assembly is practical.</p>
<p>Standard water softeners discovered in home supply and hardware stores will eliminate nearly all the calcium and magnesium from the raw water during the softening process.

Water supplies with high levels of iron and manganese (greater than 10 ppm) may need pretreatment to prolong the lifespan of a water softener.
