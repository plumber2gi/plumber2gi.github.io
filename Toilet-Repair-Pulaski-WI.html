<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the drinkable water supply and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is required to be installed. An approved, correctly installed and kept backflow assembly essentially eliminates the hazard of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a shorter life-span than gas water heaters of similar quality and capacity. Still, the difference is inadequate to make any significant modifications in the savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater may last 8-15 years, the electric option will last about 8-12 years.</p>

At this time, we do not anticipate any interruptions or effect to our services as a result of the outbreak. There are 2 standard kinds of toilet flushing systems; both types save water by utilizing 1.6 gallons of water per flush. Gravity-fed flush toilets use the force of gravity and a siphon "pull-through" action to clear the bowl. Search for gravity-fed toilets providing high efficiency to efficiently and silently dispose waste.</p>
<p>A decrease in supply side pressure caused by an incident such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire fighting, causes the supply pressure to drop below the client side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve allows the excess client side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release till the supply side pressure once again surpasses the client side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
