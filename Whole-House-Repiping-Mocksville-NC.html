<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is small, but if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>

<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Since water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly stored for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
