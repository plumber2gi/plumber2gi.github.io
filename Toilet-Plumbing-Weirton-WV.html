<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to purify water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 phases. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and removed. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to eliminate any remaining pollutants.</p>
<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (generally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
