<p>If your polybutylene pipes have actually stopped working, read your insurance coverage completely. Make certain you know what is covered and what is not covered. Many insurer will not cover a sluggish leak. Claims may be rejected due to the fact that the basic HO-3 property owners' policy specifically excludes "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over an extended time period."
