<p>The check assembly was established in the 1950s for the fire security market, developing a redundancy developed to guarantee that one check valve will continue to secure the city water system even if the other fails. This assembly also allows the closure of one valve to lower the pressure differential throughout the other, creating a more reliable seal and preventing even minor backflow leak. Test cocks, or little ball valves, enable the accessory of testing devices that evaluates whether the double check assembly is practical.</p>
<p>Although the technician agreed that the customer did the best thing in her efforts to tighten the pipes, the technician saw that the pipe had become incredibly rusted over the years which a PVC pipe might be much better fit for the client's requirements. He shut off the supply of water to the house, eliminated the rusty system and fit a PVC pipe in its location. Before leaving the house, the service technician restored water circulation and evaluated the pipe.</p>
