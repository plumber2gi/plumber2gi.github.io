If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety preventative measures you must require to safeguard yourself, your family and your house. Some jurisdictions also allow options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply.
