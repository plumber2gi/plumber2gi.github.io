<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can position problems.</p>
