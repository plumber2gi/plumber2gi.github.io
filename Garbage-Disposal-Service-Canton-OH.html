<p>This is a totally valid concern that we hear a lot. The disposal system is not, naturally, as important as your water heater, water line, or drainpipes. However, it adds a reasonable amount of functionality to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a fairly small round device set up under the kitchen drain. When switched on, your disposal unit pulls down wastewater and any material debris by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such debris. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily stream into the drain pipe in addition to the rest of your wastewater.</p>
