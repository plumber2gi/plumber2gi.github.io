It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard operational usage, water pressure presses the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain along with preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really important here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not safeguard against back pressure.  Consider this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It likewise has to lie at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
