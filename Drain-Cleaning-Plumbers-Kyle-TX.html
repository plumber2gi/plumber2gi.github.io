Mechanical determines utilized to measure test pressures will have a range such that the highest end of the scale is not greater than five times the test pressure. For instance, a 3 psi test will need a maximum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test might be performed utilizing a 50 pound gauge, however not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system shall be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge noticeable at the time of inspection.
