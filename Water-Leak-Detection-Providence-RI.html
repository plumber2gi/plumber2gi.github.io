<p>Unseen sets of pipes utilize pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a different drain path, little pipes range from the tub and sink to ultimately meet a bigger one below the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the home.
