<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system needs to be continually kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>In many cases, leakages can be sealed by welding or comparable techniques. However, if leakages keep emerging in the very same length of pipe, then it's very likely that you're handling a defect in the pipe, which needs to be changed.

As this salt water goes through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This process continues up until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about totally regrowed.</p>
