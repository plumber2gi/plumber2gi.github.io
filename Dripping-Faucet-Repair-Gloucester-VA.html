<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>

The drains are connected to vertical pipes that are typically linked to underground horizontal pipes connected to local storm sewage systems. Roto-Rooter can mechanically clean these drains from one end to the other to bring back flow and avoid water collection on top of the structure's roofing.</p>
