While gas designs are less costly to run, they do require an existing natural gas line. The price tag of an electric hot water heater is typically lower, but it can be more costly to operate. Electric varieties are also much easier to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less most likely to lose heat.

At Harris Plumbing, Heating, Air & Propane, our South Jersey repiping specialists can help you to decide for your home. When we have inspected your pipes, we can identify if repiping is necessary.

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
