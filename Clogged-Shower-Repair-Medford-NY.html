<p>310 Sewer Service: Inspects connection of the building drain to the sewer for correct depth of burial, authorized piping materials and fittings. The ditch needs to remain open until inspection approval. A study performed in 2009 by the Water Quality Research study Foundation in combination with the Battelle Memorial Institute, known as The Battelle Research study, conducted tests to help figure out how much energy cost savings a whole home water softener can provide house owners.
