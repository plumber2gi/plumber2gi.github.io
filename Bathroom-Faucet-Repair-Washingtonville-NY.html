<p>This is an entirely legitimate question that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, of course, as important as your water heater, water line, or drainpipes. However, it adds a fair quantity of functionality to the kitchen. A garbage disposal is a relatively small cylindrical device installed under the kitchen drain. When switched on, your disposal system takes down wastewater and any product debris by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such particles. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly flow into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.
