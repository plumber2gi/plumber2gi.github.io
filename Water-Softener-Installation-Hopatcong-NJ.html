<p>Hidden sets of pipes utilize pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a different drain pathway, little pipes range from the tub and sink to eventually meet up with a bigger one underneath the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and eventually out of the home. A great way to decrease the quantity of food waste in your kitchen is to install a waste disposal unit. Quickly and effectively eliminating remaining potato peels, fruit skins and many other types of food waste, the disposal grinds everything into great particles that are flushed out of the chamber and into the house drainage, waste and vent system or what you most likely call your sewer.</p>
