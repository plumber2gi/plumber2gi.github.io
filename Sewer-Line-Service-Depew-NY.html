If you are currently experiencing clogged drains, we can help! When one or more of your drains are clogged, water will frequently begin to back up into your sink, which can cause weird smells. A blocked drain can also trigger problems when flushing the toilet and result in other drain problems, like water leakages and breaking pipes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when water is completely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it typically becomes corrosive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, particularly in areas where water sits for long periods of time.
