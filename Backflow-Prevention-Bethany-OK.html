<p>I wanted to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best first experience with the start of our home improvements. George and Anthony did an amazing task for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our particular requirements for our house. I will always use them and request for George particularly for all future issues or repairs. They were timely and gave excellent pricing for what we required done.

<p>There are 2 popular install systems utilized for garbage disposers: the standard 3-bolt mount (if you've had a disposer set up for a long time, it's most likely mounted by doing this) and a newer system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a comparable system called "Quick Lock").

Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly recommend likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything remains in great shape.</p>
