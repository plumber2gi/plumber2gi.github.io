<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. When you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>

The size of the bowl along with additional choices regarding the faucet are all aspects of the process that we can assist you with.</p>
