<p>I wished to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best first experience with the start of our house enhancements. George and Anthony did an incredible job for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our particular requirements for our house. I will always utilize them and request George particularly for all future concerns or repairs. They were timely and offered excellent rates for what we required done. I extremely recommend this company for all your plumbing needs.</p>
<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
<p>An easy repair or changing private parts may be all that's required to get your water heater working again if you have a more recent unit. You may be tempted to bond or patch a leak shut or replace only a single section of pipe to conserve money. While this might operate in the short-term, remember that the weakened pipe is made of the same product as other pipes in your house, meaning that trouble might be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you comfort and avoid larger leakages down the road.</p>
