For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it intends directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can in fact cause leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leaks and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
