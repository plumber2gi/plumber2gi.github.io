<p>Hard water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is typically used in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
