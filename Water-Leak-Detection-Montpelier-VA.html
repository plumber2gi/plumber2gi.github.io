<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Given that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately constant, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily stored for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
