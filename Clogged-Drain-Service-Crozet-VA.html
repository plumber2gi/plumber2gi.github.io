<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Given that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly kept for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
