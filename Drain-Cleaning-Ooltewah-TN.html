Installing a brand-new gas line in the kitchen will typically vary from $300 to $800 depending upon the length of the pipe required. If you're converting your house to gas, or if the existing line is at capacity, expect to spend $2,000 or more.

<p>Water heater failures cause countless dollars in water damages every year. Keep in mind that when choosing your brand-new commercial hot water heater, you get what you pay for. While seemingly a bargain, a water heater ranked for only 7 years is often likely to stop working before you recoup your investment. Take a look at the cost per rated year to make an educated choice. Simply divide the cost of the water heater by the variety of years it is ranked for which will show you the best value.</p>

While this may operate in the short-term, remember that the weakened pipe is made from the very same product as other pipes in your house, indicating that problem could be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you comfort and avoid larger leaks down the road.</p>
