<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Warren NJ?</h3>

Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Since pressure is lost during these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will stream backwards into the city water lines.</p>
