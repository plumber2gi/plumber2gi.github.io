<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this brine passes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent to drain. This procedure continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain together with the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about totally regenerated.</p>
