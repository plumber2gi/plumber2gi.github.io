<p>Reverse osmosis is the process utilized to purify water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three stages. In the prefilter stage, big particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and eliminated. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to remove any remaining impurities.</p>
