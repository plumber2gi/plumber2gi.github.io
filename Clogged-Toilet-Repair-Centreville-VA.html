A good general rule for water heaters is this: due to the fact that the life-span of the typical water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle.

<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it needs to put something back into the water.

This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank renewed.</p>
