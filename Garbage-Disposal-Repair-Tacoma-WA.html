Our team of extremely knowledgeable specialists will lessen the impact our work has on the structure of your office or home and get your system working rapidly, securely, and economically. Water hardness is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the distinction on your skin is due to the fact that soap reacts with the calcium to form soap scum. This leads to the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. Which's where the term hardness" originated from ... it's difficult to wash in.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly restored, the beads become filled with salt ions from the water softener salt. As hard water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your use. When water is heated, hard water triggers gray or white deposits. Water softening can be used to minimize these symptoms.</p>
