<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system should be continuously monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed.

Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>

<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily saved for later use when need rate exceeds supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
