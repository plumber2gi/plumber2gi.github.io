When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water passes through to your home.

Salt is typically utilized in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
