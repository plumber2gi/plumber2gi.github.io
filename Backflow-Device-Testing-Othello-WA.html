<p>Backflow is bad news. Secure the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the depleted brine solution after the regeneration cycle. Clamp the drain hose firmly and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain hose pipes need to have an air gap. The end of the hose be at least two inches above the devoted drain. An air space may be used to accomplish this, and may be needed depending upon local plumbing codes.</p>
<p>The normal service is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed: whole-house repiping. If you live in an older house (developed pre-1970) or any home with galvanized steel plumbing, this is an alternative to think about. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous years, however steel ultimately suffers from corrosion and does not have the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
