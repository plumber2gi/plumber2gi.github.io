<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>

<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
<p>An RPBA is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two independently acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and listed below the first check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. An RPBA is effective versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and might be utilized to separate health or non-health dangers.</p>
