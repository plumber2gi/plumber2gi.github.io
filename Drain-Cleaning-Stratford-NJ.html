The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes based on car traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that enables water to leave.
