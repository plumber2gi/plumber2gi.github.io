<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Obviously, it's constantly much easier to avoid obstructions in the very first place. If you have a kitchen waste disposal unit, do not overload it. Feed items in a little at a time, and wait until they grind and run through completely prior to including more. Never ever put bacon grease, coffee grounds or oils down your kitchen drain, and always make sure you run lots of water down the drain after each usage. It is very important to know how to maintain and care for your all your house's plumbing components and systems to keep things running efficiently.</p>
