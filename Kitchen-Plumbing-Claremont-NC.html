<p>Homeowners can request a plumbing inspection at any time, however it is especially sensible to arrange inspections on an annual basis and when buying a new house. Call us For Professional Drain Cleaning if Your Drains Are Sluggish. Plumbers are now able to make use of video technology to see inside sewer and water lines.
