Although it's a huge job, replacing exposed pipes in a basement, crawlspace, or utility  room is relatively straightforward, because the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets should absolutely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet needs to be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural integrity of the home.</p>

The riser must be firmly connected to durable rebar or wooden stake to add structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection between the water meter and the structure plumbing before the structure is significantly total is forbidden unless a double check backflow assembly is set up and right away evaluated to ensure it is working.</p>
