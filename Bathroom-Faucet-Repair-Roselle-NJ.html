<p>You'll need a special waste disposal unit if you home uses a septic system and drain field. The system should grind the waste even finer to prevent blockages and enable the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields. Once, the gas pipe comes up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, but should then transition to galvanized. I am unsure why that should be. It is likewise permitted to use black iron if it is most likely covered with a galvanized coating (which is generally a special paint"). PG&E typically does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>

Each accomplish the exact same task with little distinction, aside from their installation. As the name suggests, the EZ Mount system is intended to be simpler to deal with when repairing an unit or installing.</p>
