In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future.
