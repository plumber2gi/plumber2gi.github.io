Galvanized steel (often recognized simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is reasonably pricey, and hard to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in typical usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to please building code non-combustibility requirements normally discovered in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications.

How often a toilet clogs depends upon the strength of its flush, the tidiness of its drain pipes, and what it's attempting to flush. If your toilet blocks more than once a month-or even when a week!- it's most likely due to the fact that mineral deposits have actually developed around the top of the drain or in the drain pipes themselves.</p>
<p>The term hard water" may sound like an oxymoron, however it's just household water which contains high concentrations of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium.

As with our trenchless services, we will first conduct pipe leak tests using video and hydraulic pressure tests.</p>
