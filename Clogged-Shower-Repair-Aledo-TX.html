<p>Standpipe systems are utilized in numerous centers, these systems are developed to supply water to fire hose connections or hose cabinets tactically installed inside a building. These systems usually are set up in big, open areas within structures, and in multistory structures for the function of manual firefighting. Standpipe systems can provide early fire suppression in these structures making it capable for a single person or firefighter to use a quick and efficient  reaction to fire. There are two types of standpipe systems, the very first type, are dry systems, which normally include no long-term water system and are pressurized through a fire department connection by fire workers responding to an occurrence. A dry standpipe system requires no backflow prevention defense. The second type is a wet standpipe system which is normally connected to the buildings drinkable water supply and needs the installation of a check valve assembly.</p>
<p>When the information collected from the field test suggests the assembly has actually deteriorated in its performance below the established minimum standard, backflow preventers should just be repaired. The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to fulfill this minimum basic, the backflow preventer need to be fixed or if necessary, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. This implies the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
