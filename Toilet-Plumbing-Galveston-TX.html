When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a danger to the digestive system.

<h3>Best Plumbing Service Company In Galveston TX</h3>
<p>Depending on the size of your home, repiping may take anywhere from a number of days to a week. Typically, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that needs total water shut down while you are out and about throughout the day, so you experience minimal interruption to your daily regimen. To begin the repiping process, the plumbing group will initially cover any carpet and furnishings to safeguard them from dust and particles. They will then make small cuts in the wall and drywall to locate the pipes and after that get rid of and replace them, leaving as much of the initial structure material as possible intact.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
