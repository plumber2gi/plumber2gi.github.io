<p>Run the warm water. Hot water is your friend, especially for your kitchen sink. Even if you are extremely cautious with what you put down your sinks, food residues and cooking oils still escape down our drains - especially the kitchen sink. Running the warm water after you have actually used your sink helps clear particles and separate food and oils and keep your drain clear. Transporting takes place when the incoming tough water follows a narrow course through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened.

Attempt reducing the tee to see if the tailpiece is long enough. If it's not, you'll need to replace it with one that's somewhat longer.</p>
<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two dead giveaways of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet.

Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, impacting your water quality.</p>
