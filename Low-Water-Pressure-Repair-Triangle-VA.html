If the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a brand-new one, getting a brand-new one is more cost-effective. Plumbing and piping innovation has improved over the last thirty years. Copper has actually been the preferred option to replace galvanized iron pipes (which used to be considered extremely strong, but they were found to break under pressure and tend to corrode within a few years).
