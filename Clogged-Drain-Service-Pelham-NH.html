<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the safe and clean water supply and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is required to be installed. An authorized, properly set up and kept backflow assembly essentially gets rid of the hazard of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a much shorter life expectancy than gas water heaters of similar quality and capability.

Where a gas heater may last 8-15 years, the electric alternative will last about 8-12 years.</p>

<p>To decrease the need of gas line repair, it's important to understand the common causes of gas leaks. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, stoves, ovens and other gas-burning home appliances take place most frequently in the winter season.

We advise installing carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to alert you of any prospective gas leakages if you haven't done so currently.</p>
