<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is consisted of six State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, one of which is likewise acts as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Plan Inspector for the group. The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if essential. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You might need to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>If you start to notice lower water pressure in your sink or shower, this could be a sign of rust and mineral build-up which will gradually start to obstruct the flow of water through your pipes.

<p>No hot water - The most apparent indication that your water heater is malfunctioning is an absence of warm water originating from the tap. You may also discover a more gradual decrease in performance, as the water might take longer to warm up, or you may not have warm water for as long as normal when you are showering or doing the dishes. Not just is a lack of warm water a big annoyance, but it might also result in higher gas or electric bills given that your unit is most likely utilizing more energy to deal with a lessened efficiency.</p>
<p>Although water-producing companies do have the chance to produce softened water, they will not always do so. A water producing company only has to include a water softener in its water filtration system, to produce softened water inexpensively. Without a specialist having actually examined your pipes, it can be challenging to know if repiping is the best response.

We can identify if repiping is necessary once we have actually checked your pipes. We can likewise discuss what type of piping products should be used depending upon your budget and objectives.</p>
