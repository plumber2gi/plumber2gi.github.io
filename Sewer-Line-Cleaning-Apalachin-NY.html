<p>Your sewer line issue can lead to sewer backups, and they usually happen in the most affordable open drain. This kind of problem is typically the outcome of a blockage in the line. If you don't find the odor coming from the sewer backup, you may determine this problem due to the fact that a backup happens whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink.
