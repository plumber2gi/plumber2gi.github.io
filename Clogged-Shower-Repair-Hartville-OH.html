When the piping in your home starts to reveal any of these indications of corrosion, you will inevitably need to repipe the entire plumbing system. The reason a toilet won't flush might be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain beneath the toilet can also be the cause. Working with a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your initial step; a plumber can detect the concern and repair it.</p>
