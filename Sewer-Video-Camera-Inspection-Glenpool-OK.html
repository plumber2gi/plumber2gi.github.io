Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly.

For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl.
